			<p>~I am a former community college instructor who became
				interested in coding while creating my online academic portfolio in
				graduate school. To effectively manage my WordPress site, it was
				necessary to learn HTML, CSS, and PHP. I learned "just enough to be
				dangerous" by scouring Internet resources. I enjoyed the process so
				much, I decided to enroll in the We Can Code IT coding bootcamp so I
			could become a full-stack web developer.~ </p>
